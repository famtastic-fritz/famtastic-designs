# FAMtastic Designs site learnings

This is the canonical record for reusable production discoveries and product
lessons. Implementation facts still belong in their subsystem runbooks and
architecture decisions; this file captures what future work must remember.

## Customer lifecycle portal

- A prospect-access link is valuable before purchase because it removes account
  friction and safely scopes a personalized proof. It is not a durable customer
  identity and should not carry a lifetime account relationship.
- Customer retention requires one identity that survives multiple campaigns,
  purchases, projects, domains, and services. Drupal user records authenticate;
  separate customer and organization records model the commercial relationship.
- The portal is a retention surface: status, files, approvals, billing, support,
  renewals, and contextual offers belong together. Upsells should follow facts
  about what the customer owns and needs, not appear as generic advertisements.
- Customer-facing language and URLs must not reveal Drupal or ask customers to
  enter the CMS administration interface.

## Commerce and recurring services

- The $199 Foot in the Door offer is a normal Commerce product reachable from
  any acquisition source, not a campaign-only transaction path.
- Domain ownership and hosting service are distinct. The customer owns the
  domain; FAMtastic manages hosting. Existing-domain customers must never be
  charged an unnecessary domain renewal.
- The first hosting year is included. Continued basic hosting is a separately
  disclosed $9.99 monthly subscription with explicit authorization, advance
  notice, cancellation, retry, and grace handling.
- Analytics access is modeled as an entitlement so its price and package rules
  can change without rebuilding the portal.

## Drupal production assets

- Drupal CSS/JS aggregation can fail when generated files under
  `sites/default/files` are denied by the host. A styled source page with 403
  aggregate assets is an asset-delivery problem, not a theme regression.
- On this host, disabling aggregation restored all admin stylesheets. Retain the
  known-good file permissions and verify stylesheet response codes after cache
  or deployment changes.

## Deployment discipline

- Git `main` and an exact clean commit remain the only deployable source.
- Frontend and backend deploy through the checked-in scripts; never edit the
  public document root or production module files directly.
- Runtime dependency additions require a platform backup and migration, not
  only a custom-module code deployment.
- Proof means browser-visible behavior plus server/API evidence, not a successful
  upload alone.
